## Special Thanks:

This application is based on two important concepts and aims to bridge the gap between the concepts 3DTiles and CityGML.
To bridge this gap, two main elements have been used in this software:

1. 3DCityDB v5
2. pg2b3dm

***We would like to take this opportunity to thank Bert Temme, the developer of the pg2b3dm library, and all 3DCityDB developers.***
